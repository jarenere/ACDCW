This page describes an adaptor from Maple Bus to USB (meaning that
you can connect your Maple Bus devices to an USB host, not the other
way around) built using only an EZ-USB2 module from Braintechnology,
and two resistors.  The current software allows Dreamcast controllers,
keyboards, and mice to be used as normal HID devices.

<p>
To build this adaptor, you need the following:

<ul>


<li>One USB High Speed Interface module from <a href="http://www.braintechnology.de/braintechnology/en/">Braintechnology</a></li>


<li>Two 10k resistors</li>


<li>One Maple Bus connector (female)</li>


</ul>

Ok, it doesn't actually have to be a Braintechnology module, as long as
you have a Cypress EZ-USB FX2 chip with all the stuff around it to make it run,
but I find them convenient to use.  As for the Maple Bus connector, a good
way to obtain one is to get a controller extension cable and cut it into
two.</p>



<p>At this point someone might wonder why I've used a USB2 chip, when
a controller hardly needs high speed mode.  Well, that's because the
FX2 has something that its USB1 cousins does not: GPIF.  Use of the
GPIF is essential in being able to recive Maple data reliably at full
speed (see below for details), and therefore it has to be the FX2.</p>



<p>Connect the parts according to the following schematic, and you're
done!

<p>
Well, the next thing needed is some software to put into the FX2.
The following software allows you to connect a Dreamcast controller,
keyboard, or mouse, and use it as a HID device.

<ul>


<li><a href="files/dchid.ihx">HID software for Maple Bus to USB Adaptor (binary)</a></li>


<li><a href="files/dchid.tar.gz">HID software for Maple Bus to USB Adaptor (source)</a></li>


</ul>

I will in the following sections give some details on how the Maple Bus
communication is implemented in this software.
</p>



<p><img alt="Transmission" valign="top" src="../_internal/graphic_text!0/hwhvnjki1vaw5xeayq6ziu4zt3iviz1$67lvjm6uhshclu1lrwt6ckiu4g0r8oh" style="border: none;" height="35" width="159" /></p>



<p>Maple Bus transmission is the simple part to implement in a microcontroller.
Because the transmitting side decides the speed of the bus, it doesn't matter
that the microcontoller isn't fast enough to transmit at full speed using
software bit operations.  So we can put the bits out at our leisure, and
the Maple Bus device will wait for them.  Hence, the transission function
<tt>maple_write()</tt> simply puts out the bits one by one at a moderate
rate.  The <tt>CTL0</tt> and <tt>CTL1</tt> pins are used to transmit, because they can be
configured in open drain mode, which is something we want.  These pins
are controlled using <tt>GPIFIDLECTL</tt>.</p>
  
<p>Worthy of note is the fact that
<tt>maple_write()</tt> does <i>not</i> return <tt>CTL1</tt> (pin 5) to the high
state in <tt>GPIFIDLECTL</tt> at the end.  This is because once pin 5 is released at the end of the
lead-out sequence, the device may start sending its response.  Therefore
the pin should not be released until we are ready to receive said response.
Since the GPIF is used to receive the response (see below), this works out
rather elegantly:  Once the GPIF read operation is triggered by the software,
the GPIF becomes active, and so <tt>CTL1</tt> is no longer controlled
by <tt>GPIFIDLECTL</tt> (the GPIF is, after all, not idle anymore) but instead
by the GPIF state machine, which constantly outputs 1 to both <tt>CTL0</tt>
and <tt>CTL1</tt>.  So <tt>CTL1</tt> will go high (open) at the very
same instant as reception is enabled.  Of course, the <tt>maple_read()</tt>
function also needs to adjust <tt>GPIFIDLECTL</tt> so that <tt>CTL1</tt>
stays high after the reception has finished.</p>

<p>This is where things get interresting.  During reception of the answer
from the Maple Bus device, the device sets the bus speed, and can blast
the bits away at speeds up to 2Mbps.  This means that trying to parse
the waveform in software by manually polling the input pins isn't going
to work out.  This is where the GPIF comes in.  The GPIF is a hardware
state machine, which can poll and act on input control signals every
clock cycle.  In each state, it either captures data on the data
pins or doesn't, and then proceeds to the next state depending on the
inputs on the control pins.  Since the pins on the Maple Bus take turns
holding data and clock, I have connected them both to the <tt>RDY0</tt>
and <tt>RDY1</tt> pins, which direct the state machine where to go,
and to the <tt>PD0</tt> and <tt>PD1</tt> pins, which are (some of) the
pins which get captured in the capture states.  The following is the
state diagram I have constructed for decoding Maple Bus with the GPIF:
<img src="states.gif"><br clear="all">

When the state machine enters state 1 or state 4 (the blue ones), the
GPIF writes the data on port D to memory.  State 1 is entered when a
data bit is clocked in during phase 1, and state 4 when a data bit is
clocked in during phase 2.  State 7, which is reached at the end of
phase 2, is a special termination state.  When the state machine gets
there, it checks if there is more space available in the buffer, and
if so starts a new cycle (at state 0).  If the buffer is full, the GPIF
halts at state 7.  This prevents the buffer from being overrun by
receiving too much data.  State 2, which is reached at the end of phase 1,
checks if pin 1 has returned to high level before pin 5.  This does not
normally happen at the end of phase 1, which is supposed to end with
pin 1 low.  So if this has happened, it must mean that the lead-out
sequence has been detected.  In this case, the machine goes to state 5
(red) where it issues an interrupt, and stays there.
The software will notice the interrupt, and stop the GPIF.
</p>



<p>After the GPIF has stopped either by reacing state 7 with a full
buffer or by being halted by the software in response to either the
interrupt from state 5 or a timeout interrupt, <tt>maple_read()</tt>
will call the function <tt>bits_to_bytes()</tt> to decode the data stored
by the GPIF.  Since the GPIF stores the entire contents of port D (which
is 16 bits wide) in each "blue" state, it means that a single bit of
payload data needs to be extracted from each group of 16 bits (alternately
bit 0 and bit 1), and this is what <tt>bits_to_bytes()</tt> does.  It should
be noted that because of this 16 x size explosion during capture, the
buffer (which is 1 Kbyte in size) will only be able to hold 61 bytes worth of Maple data.  Packets
longer than that will be truncated to the first 61 bytes.</p>
