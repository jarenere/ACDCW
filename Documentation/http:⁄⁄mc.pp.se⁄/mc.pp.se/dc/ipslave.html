The IP upload slave is intended as a replacement for the
<a href="serslave.html">Serial upload slave</a>.  By using the
Broadband Adapter (ethernet interface, that is) instead of the serial
port, much better performance can be obtained, and the need for custom
hardware is eliminated.


<p><b>20010131:</b> V1.002 released.  Now supports Quake3 IP settings and
works with programs that return to the slave.</p>

First, <a href="files/ip_slave.tar.gz">download</a> the IP upload
slave and burn it onto a CD-R using the instructions available
<a href="cdr.html">elsewhere</a>.  Then boot the DC from this CD-R.
You should get an orange screen displaying your ethernet address and
IP address and hostname (if set).  If you instead get back to the main menu
after the SEGA logo, check that your Broadband Adapter is properly installed.

If you have configured a static IP number in your broadband browser, the
IP upload slave should be able to find and use this number.  If not,
the slave will not know its own IP number.  DHCP is not supported.
However, not knowing its own IP number will only affect the slaves ability
to identify itself via ARP.  If you add the Dreamcast's MAC address
(displayed at the top of the screen) to your computers address resolution
table manually, you can upload to the IP slave even if it doesn't have
any idea about its IP address.

<p><img alt="Communicating with the serial upload slave" valign="top" src="../_internal/graphic_text!0/hlcfhu1cyw2cyj7k6g8xd5wjq7q2w5y$679ks7g0lwsmb24xf17srsmouky7lnw" style="border: none;" height="23" width="357" /></p>

To make the slave run a program, connect to TCP port 4711 on the Dreamcast,
and write an ELF binary.  When the socket is closed, the program will be
started if received correctly.  To abort an upload, just close the socket
before the entire binary is sent.

Currently, only ELF32 little endian (elf32-shl) is supported.  If there
is great demand for COFF, that could probably be added...
